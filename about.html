        <h2>About CLEAN BIOSPHERE</h2>
        <p>Ecosystem Services: A clean biosphere provides essential services, including air and water purification, climate regulation, soil fertility, and pollination. These services are crucial for human survival and well-being.

            Biodiversity: Healthy ecosystems support diverse plant and animal species, contributing to genetic diversity. This biodiversity is vital for resilience against diseases, climate change, and other environmental stresses.
            
            Human Health: Pollution and environmental degradation can lead to serious health issues, including respiratory diseases, waterborne illnesses, and food contamination. A clean biosphere reduces these risks, promoting better health outcomes.
            
            Economic Value: Natural resources, such as forests, oceans, and wetlands, provide significant economic benefits through tourism, agriculture, and fisheries. A clean biosphere enhances these resources' sustainability and productivity.
            
            Threats to the Biosphere
            
            Pollution: Industrial, agricultural, and urban activities release harmful pollutants into air, water, and soil, leading to ecosystem degradation. Plastic waste and toxic chemicals pose severe threats to wildlife and human health.
            
            Climate Change: Rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events disrupt ecosystems, leading to habitat loss and species extinction. Climate change also exacerbates pollution and resource depletion.
            
            Deforestation and Habitat Loss: Urbanization and agricultural expansion result in habitat destruction, threatening countless species and reducing biodiversity. Forests play a crucial role in carbon sequestration and oxygen production.
            
            Overexploitation of Resources: Unsustainable fishing, logging, and mining practices deplete natural resources and harm ecosystems. This overexploitation disrupts ecological balance and diminishes ecosystem services.
            
            Invasive Species: Non-native species can outcompete native species for resources, leading to declines in biodiversity and altering ecosystem dynamics.
